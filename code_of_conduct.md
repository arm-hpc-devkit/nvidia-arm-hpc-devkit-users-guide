# Arm HPC Developer Kit Community Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct governs the Arm HPC Developer Kit Community's Community Slack, virtual and in-person events and any other online discussions.

## Introduction
* Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
* Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.
* This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities — online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expected Behavior
* Be welcoming.
* Be kind.
* Look out for each other.

## Unacceptable Behavior
* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
  * Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
  *  Do not show disrespect towards others (jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes).
* Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
* Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
* Sustained disruptions.
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Enforcement
* Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
* If violations occur, organizers will take any action they deem appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion.
